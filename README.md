# reschedule-tsu-spring
Core server for custom timetable endpoints. Made for my friends from Tver State University.  

## Main purpose  
 - Import timetable from remote DB.
 - Serve a REST service to access imported info.
 - Reduce count of request to remote DB.  

## Important information  
Please, do not use it in production independently from us!  
Instead, request info about deployed server here: info@a6raywa1cher.com  
We really don't want to seriously increase load on remote db.  

## Contribution
Any feature requests, improvements, bug and security reports are welcome!
